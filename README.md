## Inspiration
 After the COVID-19 pandemic, many small businesses wiped away. Right now, due to high inflation, big business are crushing local businesses, and they are forced to shut down. In order to give back to the community and support local economies, we created Business Ship.
 
 

## What it does
Business Ship brings microentrepreneurs, and they help the small-businesses to generate revenue by selling their products to consumers. Through this, customers could also directly contact the businesses and negotiate directly. This would help in creating a healthy & thriving local economy.



## How we built it
 The website was built with HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript. Along with these, we used Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp for interacting with people. The website was deployed using Github-pages & a custom domain was used.

## Challenges we ran into
 The biggest challenge faced by us was the integration of WhatsApp in Twilio Sandbox.
 
 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
 The User-Interface of the website is really minimal and intuitive. 
 
 

## What we learned
 Learned Twilio and how to deploy WhatsApp for Twilio Sandbox.
 DALL-E was fun, the logo was generated by an AI :) 



## What's next for Business Ship
 Introducing a chatbot directly connected with e-mail.
 Show location-wise data of small businesses so that people could support them.
